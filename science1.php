					<h1>THE SCIENCE OF LAGREE FITNESS™</h1>
					<p>THE LAGREE FITNESS™ TRAINING METHOD is taught on an exclusive technology developed by fitness visionary, Sebastien Lagree. Physical fitness is more than being able to run a long distance or lift heavy weights at the gym; or how long you worked out or at what intensity… While these are important measures of fitness, they only address single areas. Physical fitness is made up of five basic elements: Cardio, Strength, Endurance, Body Composition, and Flexibility. Where many workouts and exercise regimens work to integrate as many of these elements as possible, Lagree Fitness™ meets all the elements to physical fitness; not just in 1 session but in each and every move.
					<br><br>
					Physical Fitness is defined by the following five basic foundations:</p>

					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb1.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE</h4>
							<p>Cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability of the body’s circulatory and respiratory systems (heart and lungs) to supply fuel to the tissues and cells during sustained physical activity. To improve your cardiorespiratory endurance, train doing activities that keep your heart rate elevated at a safe level for a sustained length of time. Typically the aerobic system kicks in after 60 seconds of constant uninterrupted physical effort.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb2.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">MUSCULAR STRENGTH</h4>
							<p>Muscular strength is the ability of the muscle to exert force during an activity. The key to making your muscles stronger is working them against resistance: weights, gravity, and/or springs. Lagree Fitness™ allows your body to train in counter-resistance to improve muscular strength.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb3.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">MUSCULAR ENDURANCE</h4>
							<p>Muscular endurance is the ability of the muscle to continue to perform without fatigue. This is the ability for your body to keep working during continuous movement. Ironically, in order to perform without fatigue, you need to train the muscles to fatigue. Lagree Fitness™ trains the muscles to a threshold of intensity that will stimulate improvement.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb4.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">BODY COMPOSITION</h4>
							<p>Body composition refers to the relative amount of muscle, fat, bone, and other vital parts of the body that make up the entire body. A person’s total body weight (what you see on the bathroom scale) may not change over time, but the bathroom scale does not assess how much of that body weight is fat and how much is lean mass Lagree Fitness™ promotes fat loss and lean muscle growth to improve the total body composition.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb5.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">FLEXIBILITY</h4>
							<p>Flexibility is the range of motion around a joint. Good flexibility in the joints can improve postures and alignment as well as help prevent injuries through all stages of life. If you want to improve your flexibility, your must perform activities that lengthen the muscles. Lagree works the muscle in its length which improves flexibility.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<p>In addition to these 5 basic components of Physical Fitness, it is important to consider 2 more:</p>
					<h3>CORE STRENGTH AND BALANCE</h3>
					<p>Core Strength is the ability for the body to stabilize during movement. It incorporates the abdominals, pelvis, lower back and diaphragm. Your balance is your ability to maintain your support with minimal sway. The torso is the body’s center of power, so the more strength and stability trained in this area, the better chances you will have in preventing injuries and maintaining good alignment and posture. Lagree Fitness™ focuses heavily on core stabilizing exercises and maintaining good form throughout each and every move.</p>
					<h3>MENTAL HEALTH</h3>
					<p>More and more research is coming out on the endless benefits of a healthy mind or a positive mind and its affect on the body. “The heaviest weight to lift is the weight of a negative mind.” But mental health is more than just positive thinking; it’s your self-esteem. How you really feel about yourself affects everything else in your life. People with good self-esteem have an abundance of confidence and are better at managing stress and avoiding self-destructive behaviors such as compulsive eating and so forth. Feeling great about yourself impacts your behavior which impacts your body composition. Most of the emails that I receive from the students are not only about how the training has changed their body but also how it has impacted their lives in a positive way.</p>
					<h1>LAGREE FITNESS AND EFFECTIVE MUSCLE STIMULATION</h1>
					<p>Put simply, LAGREE FITNESS™ is the only workout that EFFECTIVELY combines Strength, Endurance, Cardio, Balance, Core and Flexibility training not only in one session but in each and every move. The key term here is effective. Lagree Fitness™ is intense on the muscles, but low-impact and safe on the joints, spine, and connective tissues.
					<br><br>
					In order for a training method to be effective, it is important to train at an Effective Intensity. The body needs to reach a certain threshold of exercise intensity to stimulate the body’s adaptive changes. Reaching the intensity threshold depends on many factors such as body type and fitness level, and is different for everyone. When the body is training at an effective intensity and the muscles are being effectively stimulated, the results can be maximized. The Lagree Fitness™ Training Method utilizes 5 key elements to reach Effective Muscle Stimulation:

						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb6.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">EFFECTIVE RESISTANCE</h4>
							<p>Lagree Fitness™ uses spring resistance which is variable and allows for peak muscle contraction while reducing the stress on the joints and the connective tissue.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb7.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">EFFECTIVE RANGE OF MOTION</h4>
							<p>Lagree Fitness™ focuses on form and each movement is kept within the range of motion that targets the specific muscle or group of muscles.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb8.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">EFFECTIVE ANGLE</h4>
							<p>The Lagree Fitness™ equipment is adjustable to allow for training at different angles to help recruit different muscle groups.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb9.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">EFFECTIVE TEMPO</h4>
							<p>Lagree Fitness™ utilizes slow and controlled movements. None of the movements are performed using momentum. When working with and against resistance slowly, the tension on muscles stays constant, recruiting more muscle fibers. Slow and controlled movements activate the slow-twitch fat-burning muscle fibers.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="media mrgT30">
						<div class="media-left"><a href="#"><img class="media-object" src="images/science1-thumb10.jpg" alt="CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE"></a></div>
						<div class="media-body">
							<h4 class="media-heading">EFFECTIVE DURATION</h4>
							<p>Each set is performed for at least 60 seconds to stimulate both the fast and slow-twitch muscle fibers. Transitions are kept to a minimum to keep the muscles working and the heart rate up.</p>
